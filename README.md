This is Yoga Outreach. A Wordpress custom theme designed to express the meaning of tranquility browsing.

The goal for this project was to construct a fully functional custom theme mimicing the design comps that were handed to us from the UI UX design team. 

## What did we use?
* Php
* JavaScript
* Html
* Scss
* Gulp
* Wordpress

## Phase 1

At the beginning we designated pages off to each other tackling the project in separate sections. We ran through the site HTML skeleton and put together a foundation to work off. Minor CSS was applied to for some of us visual workers. 

## Phase 2

Some of us have figured that CFS (Custom Field Suites) would be a useful addition to our site for these custom fields where our user can dynamically input content. 

We figured out within our CFS we can create loops which allows us to iterate over a foreach loop to generate multiple fields. This way we don’t need to hardcode any content base material.

## Phase 3

Soon after custom fields were in play, we started building site wide functions which would toggle dropdowns that made our content appear and disappear. Hamburger menus and window width toggles were also created for responsiveness between mobile and desktop view.

## Phase 4

Mixins and variables we’re decided upon the team making styling much easier also for quick easy restyling of any variables.
Most mobile view are completed at this point with it being functional and mostly styled.

## Phase 5

Desktop views are being developed and reconstructed. Many pages had big style changes which we had to get around by making custom html showing and hiding them when specific viewpoints were met. 
A modular quiz page was built with a unlocking stage function disabling the user to move on to the next step until the present step is passed.

## Phase 6 

Most of the site is styled and functional as well as page navigation. Wordpress has built in features letting us to get page links to navigate through the site. 
We had multiple meetings to layout our final stretch of the site as well as building all the stretch goals. 

## Phase 7

The site is now both mobile and desktop compatible With our final meeting we went through the last of the issues that need to be addressed and here we stand with the site being 98% completed.. 

This custom theme has many customizable features including.. 
Custom post types
Custom field suites
All uploadable images
Page titles
Page content.
